Hello and welcome to my assignment 1.02.

There are a few simple things that make this program possible and I'm going to list out what
makes this program tick.

First off building the project is easy, just a simple "make" is all you need to get started,
then there should be a terrain_out you can use to run the program.

The program is split into multiple directories: Queue, Terrain, and Main.

Main:
    This only has the main function, this function is responsible for
    making the call to the initialize the board and handle user input

Terrain:
    Terrain is the heavy lifter of the project, it handles structs: board,seed,
    and square. It is also responsible for initializing the board, printing current square, checking tiles, generating a map, and a lot more.

Queue:
    Simple queue nothing more nothing less.

DJ:
    does the Dijkstra's as it should

Turn:
    handles npc function
    *NEW*
    Turn has also evolved to handle and turnbased movement, battles, and other
    interfaces for the game, This file right here is becoming a very large part
    of this game
