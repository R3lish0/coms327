Hello and welcome to my assignment 1.07.

There are a few simple things that make this program possible and I'm going to list out what
makes this program tick.

First off building the project is easy, just a simple "make" is all you need to get started,
then there should be a terrain_out you can use to run the program.

The program is split into multiple directories: Queue, Terrain, and Main.

Main:
    This only has the main function, this function is responsible for
    making the call to the initialize the board and handle user input

Terrain:
    Terrain is the heavy lifter of the project, it handles structs: board,seed,
    and square. It is also responsible for initializing the board, printing current square, checking tiles, generating a map, and a lot more.

Queue:
    Simple queue nothing more nothing less.

DJ:
    does the Dijkstra's as it should

Turn:
    handles npc function
    Turn has also evolved to handle and turnbased movement, battles, and other
    interfaces for the game, This file right here is becoming a very large part
    of this game

Data:
    This handles all data from the csv databases, both population and printing

CONTROLS:


Flying: hit F then where you would like to go ("enter" between numbers is needed)

KEEP IN MIND: It's best not to hold down keys (that sometimes messes with the program)


OPTIONAL FLAGS:

--numtrainers <int>
    The int determines number of trainers on each map

--pokemon
    prints all pokemon data from database

--moves
    prints all move data from database

--pokemon_moves
    prints all pokemon moves from database

--pokemon_species
    prints all pokemon species from database

--experience
    prints all exp from database

--type_names
    prints all type names from database

--pokemon_stats
    prints all pokemon stats from database

--stats
    prints all stats from database

--pokemon_types
    prints all pokemon types from database
